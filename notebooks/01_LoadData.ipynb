    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are processing physiological recordings from a family therapy session. The goal is to organize, preprocess, and segment the physiological data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we doing?\n",
    "We are loading raw physiological data for each participant in a session, processing the data, segmenting it into epochs, and saving the processed session for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are we doing it?\n",
    "Segmenting and processing physiological data enables us to analyze patterns and interactions between participants during therapy sessions. This can provide insights into physiological synchrony, emotional responses, and other relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are we doing it?\n",
    "1. **Setup:** Import necessary modules and helper functions.\n",
    "2. **Load COI Structure:** Read the configuration file that maps data files to each participant.\n",
    "3. **Session Initialization:** Create a `Session` object and add `Subject` and `PhysioRecording` objects for each participant.\n",
    "4. **Data Loading:** Load raw physiological data for each participant.\n",
    "5. **Processing:** Apply preprocessing steps to clean and standardize the data.\n",
    "6. **Epoching:** Segment the processed data into fixed-duration epochs.\n",
    "7. **Saving:** Save the processed session object for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Results\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, we expect to have a serialized session object containing preprocessed and segmented physiological data for all participants, ready for downstream analysis."
